# Laboratory Manual for Biology II

This is an open source, open educational resource (OER) laboratory manual that I am  developing for the SCI104 Biology II course at [Roxbury Community College](http://www.rcc.mass.edu) in Boston, Massachusetts. This introductory course focuses on n on organismal biology. A second manual is under development for the SCI103 Biology I course that is focused on the cellular and molecular aspects of biology.

I am developing this manual as [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) but license it under the [Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en) United States License because I love [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org) from which I have heavily borrowed.

On the technology side, I got started by cloning Yihui Xie's [rstudio/bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) site. I discovered bookdown because after reading Garrett Grolemund's and Hadley Wickham's [R for Data Science book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz), which is a pleasure to read on any screen including the mobile phone.

The current current version of this manual is available [here](https://nikolaussucher.github.io/bio-two/). ePub and PDF versions can be downloaded by clicking on the download link in the navigation toolbar at the top of each page.
